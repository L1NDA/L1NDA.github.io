# Personal Website

A simple personal website I made for myself that I am slowly adding to
and building on.

Last update: add resume and contact links

Previous updates: added snap scrolling and a gradient background

Next goal: create platform to show photography/design portfolio for small-scale commissions around the Harvard area
