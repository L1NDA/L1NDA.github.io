        DIV was a personal summer project to create a better platform to enhance <b>productivity</b>.
        <br><br>Inspired by the Chrome extension Momentum and based off of research on how to <b>work smarter</b>,
        I employed a <b>2x2 priority matrix</b> that organizes to-dos in order of <b>importance</b> and <b>urgency</b>.
        I also later added a notes tab as I found myself wanting to jot down quick information as well.
        <br><br>Using Google's Firebase, the data is <b>persistent</b> and <b>personalized</b> for each user.
        Although it is currently a front-end website on the ReactJS framework, the final goal is to
        transfer this over to a <b>Chrome new-tab extension</b> â€“ keep tuned for updates!
